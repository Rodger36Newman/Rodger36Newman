## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm a junior front-end developer passionate about building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. Currently, I'm diving into the Vue.js ecosystem and using this space to document my learning journey through small, focused projects. Whether itâ€™s a simple component or a full single-page application, each project is an opportunity to deepen my understanding of modern web development practices.

As I continue to grow in this field, Iâ€™m particularly interested in mastering the fundamentalsâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”while also exploring how frameworks like Vue.js make it easier to build dynamic and interactive user experiences. I believe in learning by doing, so this repository will serve as both a portfolio and a sandbox where I experiment with new concepts, techniques, and tools.

I'm also beginning to explore complementary technologies such as Vue Router, Pinia, and component libraries like Vuetify and Tailwind CSS. These tools are helping me understand the broader picture of front-end development and how to build scalable, maintainable applications. I'm excited about following best practices, writing clean code, and improving my debugging and problem-solving skills along the way.

This repository is a work in progress and a reflection of my growth as a developer. If youâ€™re also learning Vue.js or just browsing through beginner-friendly code, feel free to explore, fork, or offer feedback. Iâ€™m always open to collaboration, suggestions, and connecting with others in the developer community.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something here that inspires or helps you on your own development journey.
